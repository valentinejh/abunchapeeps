<p><code>This is a word game that was created with an intention of providing an enjoyable story based game that includes; Gen Z humour, interesting plot twists and unique characters.
    The objective of this game is to identify the killer among the group. In the last question of the game, you will be able to have one attempt at guessing who the killer is 
    and if you are incorrect, you will have to restart. This insinuating that you would have won the game if you correctly indentify the killer.</code></p>
